# automatic-free-badges
Instructions:
Note: For your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie if you use third-party hosting platforms I strongly recommend using an alt with team create!

1. Install the library `requests` (pip install requests or pip3 install requests, and make sure you have python installed!)
2. Open config.py. From here, in `cookie` input your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie (search a tutorial for your browser if you don't know how or use EditThisCookie), in `universeid` input the universeId for the place you will add badges to (get from the creator page URL for the universe page), and `badgename` and `badgedescription` to whatever you want.
3. Run `main.py`. Make sure you can run this script 24/7.

# Error codes
If you don't get status code 200 everytime, refer to this.

401 - Your cookie is invalid. Make sure it has no spaces or line breaks and you are accessing the cookie from the IP the account was logged in from.
403 - You cannot manage the game you are trying to access.
400 - Usually occurs when you have an invalid badge name.
500 - Something's wrong with Roblox; this is not your fault.
429 - Too many requests. Make sure you aren't making lots of requests to Roblox.
404 - Really rare occasions when the code is probably obsolete. Open an issue if you get this; this is most likely my bad coding.
