# automatic-free-badges
Instructions:
Note: For your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie if you use third-party hosting platforms I strongly recommend using an alt with team create!

1. Install the library `requests` (pip install requests or pip3 install requests, and make sure you have python installed!)
2. Open config.py. From here, in `cookie` input your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie (search a tutorial for your browser if you don't know how or use EditThisCookie), in `universeid` input the universeId for the place you will add badges to (get from the creator page URL for the universe page), and `badgename` and `badgedescription` to whatever you want.
3. Run `main.py`. Make sure you can run this script 24/7.
